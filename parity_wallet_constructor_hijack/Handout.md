The goal of this challenge is to understand how the Parity Wallet Hack of November 2017 was done. 
In this assignment, you will be provided with starter code very similar to that of the actual (now deprecated) Parity Wallets.

You have two contracts, Wallet and WalletLibrary. Many Wallets can use methods from the WalletLibrary. An example of how a Wallet calls methods from the WalletLibrary can be found in starter.sol. Your goal is to siphon off any and all ether (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain) from the WalletLibrary contract. 

Do your own research online and see <b>if</b> you can find use inbuilt solidity functions that may help you.

These articles may help you get started :)
