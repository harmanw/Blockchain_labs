### Installations (use sudo if necessary)

Install ganache (Provides blockchain vm simulation)
$ npm install -g ganache-cli

Install truffle
$ npm install -g truffle

### Running the tests

open ganache cli in a seperate terminal window and leave it open
$ ganache-cli

In a new terminal, cd into dao_reentrancy_exploit/autograder/grader

To test a single submission [ use -s ], execute 
$ ./runtest.sh -s ../sample/student2

To test multiple submissions togther [ use -d ], execute 
$ ./runtest.sh -d ../sample



### Help for when runtest throws an error and crashes.

When runtest fails with a migration error, the most probable issue is that the ganache cli wallets are out of ether.
> To fix this, simple end the ganache-cli process and execute `ganache-cli` again in a new window. 

(I have tried to automate this in the runtest script in the new_ganacheCLI function, but I haven't got it working yet.)
