Files provided: attacker.sol, dao.sol

The goal of this challenge is to understand how the infamous Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) hack of Aprl 2016 happened. 

In this assignment you will play two roles: 

1. The attacker - As an attacker, you will attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the DAO smart contract and steal some money. (The hackers of 2016 stole more than 3.6 million ether, which would be worth more than 600 Million USD today)

2. The DAO Developer - As a developer for the DAO, you will find this vulnerability that an attacker might exploit and fix it. (This might save you a lot of money someday)

Part 1: The Attacker
You are provided with attacker.sol. There are rumours on the dark web that dao.sol is vulnerable to what is known as the reentrancy attack. This means that when a user calls a method of the dao contract, some path of steps might lead to the dao contract calling another method of the user's contract, leading to a loop of sorts. 
As an attacker, you must try to use this to transfer all of the money from the dao contract to your contract.

Part 2: The DAO
After the hack of 2016, your boss is really mad at you. You must find the vulnerability that the attacker exploited and fix it immediately, lest more attackers fiigure it out and steal even more ether. You are provided with dao.sol. Find and fix the vulnerability that caused the reentrancy attack.
